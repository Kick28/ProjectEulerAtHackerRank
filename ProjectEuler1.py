Project Euler #1: Multiples of 3 and 5
    Task: Q. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
    get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

'''
First-try iterative-based solution, that has bad optimization and takes a lot of time to compute.
sum = 0
for i in range(n):
    if((i % 3 ==0) or (i % 5 == 0)):
        sum = sum + i
print(sum)
